# Simulation of Echo Path Cancellation in Audio Signals

This project simulates echo path cancellation in audio signals using adaptive filtering techniques. Echo cancellation improves audio quality in communication systems by reducing reflected sounds that cause disruptive echoes.

## Features

- Adaptive filter implementation for echo path estimation
- Simulation of echo generation and cancellation
- Performance evaluation and visualization of results
- MATLAB source code for easy replication and modification

## Installation

1. Install MATLAB (R2018a or later recommended).
2. Clone or download this repository.
3. Open the project folder in MATLAB.

## Usage

Run the main MATLAB script `echo_cancellation_simulation.m` to start the simulation. The script generates audio signals with echo effects and applies the echo cancellation algorithm.
